# Create an incentive protocol for volunteers to gate access to an suite of tier gated services.

## Tools

1. **Worldcoin** - proof of humanity
2. **Polygon ID** - issue and verify credentials 
3. **Filecoin** -  storage and compute 
4. **Uniswap v4** - hook to gate access w/ credentials / NFT 

## Components / User Flow

1. Volunteer uploads photo/video of footage of environmental service to Filecoin database 
2. System verification of the entry (executed by an AI model - kinetic 400(441 - garbage collecting)
3. System points to volunteerâ€™s account (given the positive verification) 
4. Volunteer claims Polygon ID, which provides them access to benefits and services 
    1. The Polygon ID can be claimed at a designated number of points 
    2. There are different benefits and services at different point tiers: Tier I, Tier II, Tier III

## Services

- **Uniswap v4 hook** to provide access to only people with certain credentials (Polygon ID)
- AI chatbot
- Private events, including travel stipends for global events
